you can also export functions, not just classes.
When you explicitly export, it is called a named export.

named exports are imported with the curly braces in the import statement

like :
	import {Teacher} from "./teacher"
	
export default class Teacher {}
would be imported with:

import {Teacher} from "./teacher"


from a class that has function promote() for example:

class Teacher(){
	export function promote|(){}
}


in another file you can import it with

import {promote} from './teacher'


curly braces are used to import a named export
if you use the default keyword to export,
you don't have to use the curly braces


you can import both types in the same line

import Teacher ,{promote} from './teacher'
