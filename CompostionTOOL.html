To use composition instead of inheritance
build objects that will be properties and methods of the target object
and then include them or mix them into the target object.

So for instance build objects for an animal class

Eat
Walk
Swim
Sleep

Build the animals
Fish 
Dog 
Human

And add the method objects to the animals

<script>
const canEat = {
eat: function(){this.hunger--;
	console.log('eating');}
	
	};
const canWalk = {walk: function(){console.log('walking')}};

const person = Object.assign({}, canEat, canWalk);
console.log(person)

</script>

--------------------------------------------------------
can do this in a constructor
<script>
const canEat = {
eat: function(){this.hunger--;
	console.log('eating');}
	
	};
const canWalk = {walk: function(){console.log('walking')}};
function Person(){
}
Object.assign(Person.prototype, canEat, canWalk);

</script>

a function to build compostions called mixin
<script>
function mixin(target, ...mixin) //"..." is the rest argument creates an array
{ Object.assign(target, ...sources);} //"..." is the spread operator - spreads the array

//then call the composition function
mixin(Person.prototype, canEat, canWalk)
</script>
