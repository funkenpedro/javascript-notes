Prototypical Inheritance


new Circle.prototype.constructor(1)
is the same as
new Circle(1)

when you inherit from another class using:

Circle.prototype = Object.create(Shape.prototype);
new Circle.prototype.constructor() will create a new shape.

So also add:

Circle.prototype.constructor = Circle;
