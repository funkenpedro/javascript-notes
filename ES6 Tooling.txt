Create bundles of modules and translate them to ES5 with Babel and 
Webpack.

Steps -
Create a folder for the project
run npm init --yes
this creates package.json
which includes info about the project

install babel:
npm i babel-cli@6.26 babel-core@6.26.0 babel-preset-env@1.6.1 --save-dev

in vs code
add the index.js file
then use babel to convert the file

in package.json in scripts add
"babel": "babel --presets env index.js -o build/index.js"
in npm now if you type 
npm run babel it will run the build.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
if you have a lot of files in your project use webpack to build them
WEBPACK
+++++++++++++++++
npm i -g webpack-cli@2.0.14   //this installs webpack globally

in the projects folder enter

webpack-cli init
this asks you questions, it will also install webpack for you

then run npm init --yes to create the package.json
add a new script called "build":"webpack"

then in the terminal enter:
npm run build
then in the index.html file change the source to the 
bundle name created.

if you add -w to build command it will watch if you 
chang the source file and webpack will rerun the build for you
